# Nvim Configuration
`/docs`: Contains information from reading different help files. Has many todos to later explore.
`./init.lua`: Main entrypoint. Adds package manager and requires other important config files (options, remaps, autocmds)
`./lua/`: Beginning of cusotm c

## Future Improvements
- Either do C# development fully in Nvim, or figure out how to minimally configure .ideavim to have a similar experience + keymaps
    - since its in Lua, might be difficult to do this.
