- Plugins store their data in predictable location based on stdpath, thanks to Lazy
- our RTP is searched for the files we are using (such as under the lua folder)

Lua modules are just filepaths, and an init.lua in it lets us omit the final filepath.

`pcall` to not crash if an errors encountered while requiring a module
`[[STRINGLITERAL]]` lua string literal syntax, to avoid escaping chars
theres a few ways to set a vim var at diff scopes (vim.g for global, vim.b for current buffer)


there are mapping options to be aware of, such as setting for only current buffer
TODO: use this for qfix list? maybe i already do haha
â€¢ `expr`: If set to `true`, do not execute the {rhs} but use the return value
  as input. Special |keycodes| are converted automatically. For example, the following
  mapping replaces <down> with <c-n> in the popupmenu only: >lua
    vim.keymap.set('c', '<down>', function()
      if vim.fn.pumvisible() == 1 then return '<c-n>' end
      return '<down>'
    end, { expr = true })
